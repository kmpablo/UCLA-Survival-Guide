        <h2>Bruinwalk</h2>
        <p class="description2">Bruinwalk is the "Rate My Professor" version for UCLA students ran by the school newspaper Daily Bruin. The website contains anonymous students reviews on almost every professor and class at UCLA. It is extremely helpful for picking the right professors and finding the best major and GE courses for a perfectly balanced schedule.

        <p class="description2"><b>Tips to keep in mind:</b></p>
        <ul class="description2">
            <li>Choose 3-4 classes each quarter with a mix of major and GE courses (ex. 2 major, 1 GE; 2 major, 2 GEs).</li>
            <li>Reviews are often written by students who have strong feelings towards a class either good or bad, so take them with a grain of salt. 
            <li>Don't base your classes solely on Bruinwalk. Having interest in a class is also very important!</li>  
        </ul>

        <h2>Coursicle</h2>
        <p class="description2">Enrollment is competitive at UCLA, so don't be discouraged if the class you want to take gets filled up! Make sure to do your research ahead of time to find alternates for every class. However, if you really need a class, you can download Coursicle on your phone to track a class you want. Just select the class you want, and Coursicle will send you a notification letting you know that there is an open spot in the class. The only downside is that you can only track one class at a time. You can track multiple classes by paying $4.99 each quarter, but often times, it is not necessary.</p>
