    <h2>Academic Counseling Unit</h2>
    <p class="description2">Academic Counseling is provided to all UCLA students based on their college. Academic counselors provide academic advising, such as planning your courses throughout the 4 years, reviewing graduation requirements, and providing professional and personal guidance towards your goals. The counseling unit is also where you submit unit petitions and change/declare your major(s) and minors. Check your Degree Audit Report (DAR) on myUCLA to see which counseling unit you belong to.</p>
