       It may take a while to obtain a financial advisor over the phone (especially at the beginning of each quarter and before summer sessions). It would be best to send 
       the office a message through the ucla messaging center (a link is provided above but you can also acess it throug your MyUcla account) or by going in person. <b>NOTE:
       Due to the pandemic the office is currently clsoed. </b>

       Try using multiple ways of contacting the office.
